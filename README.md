  I am a self-motivated QA professional passionate about unearthing bugs and elevating the quality of a product.
  
Having a great enthusiasm for Software Testing I specialize in ensuring the highest quality of software through comprehensive testing processes and methodologies. My experience includes manual testing, test automation, and exploratory testing across a variety of applications.

I am skilled in using testing tools and technologies such as JIRA, Selenium, Maven, Git, etc. My strong analytical and problem-solving skills allow me to quickly identify issues and work collaboratively with development teams to resolve them.

My goal is to continue to develop my skills and knowledge as a Software Tester and contribute to the success of software development projects through comprehensive and effective testing processes.
